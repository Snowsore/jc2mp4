Idea from https://github.com/carykh/jumpcutter

原程序太慢了，我重写了，更改了输出的方式
The original program is too slow for my machine
So I rewrite the conversion method

It's use ffmpeg filter to trim and change speedrate
Then merge the video

I don't know python too much, I don't undersand what the original is doing
So I have to rewrite the whole program

And I need help, I'm new to github, do I need pull request from original?
